# java_utils_checks

## What is this?

Java utility classes to perform basic runtime checks, similar to what is done with:

* [Java `assert` keyword](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html)
* [JUnit 4 `org.junit.Assert` class](https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/latest/org/junit/Assert.html)
* [JUnit 5 `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` class](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.0.1/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html)
* [Google Guava's "Preconditions"](https://guava.dev/releases/snapshot-jre/api/docs/com/google/common/base/Preconditions.html).

### Further reading: Design by Contract

For more complete/elegant approaches, see the Wikipedia entry for [Design by Contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) (note that this word construction has been [trademarked by Eiffel Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract#History)). Some projects that seem live in the Design-by-Contract area are:

*For Java:*

* [Cofoja Contracts for Java]([https://code.google.com/p/cofoja/](https://github.com/nhatminhle/cofoja)) - LGPL-3.0
* [Java Contract Suite](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcontracts/) (resurrection of the iContract tool from Reliable Systems) - Apache License V2.0
* [Contract4J](http://deanwampler.github.io/contract4j/) - Eclipse Public License V1.0
* [C4J](https://github.com/C4J-Team/C4J) - Eclipse Public License V1.0
   * See also: [C4J - Design By Contract for Java (2nd gen.)](http://c4j-team.github.io/C4J/index.html)

### Expressing pass/fail conditions in Java

For an interesting way to express the pass/fail conditions in Java, generally in Unit Tests:

* [Hamcrest Matchers](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/)
* [AssertJ](https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/) - fluent assertions for Java, allowing the IDE to suggest method calls as you type, also chainable.
* [Truth](https://truth.dev/api/latest/index.html?overview-summary.html) - also fluent assertions for Java, but not chainable
   * See [Truth vs. AssertJ and Hamcrest](https://truth.dev/comparison.html).

A failing AssertJ and a failing JUnit 5 test throws [`org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError`](https://ota4j-team.github.io/opentest4j/docs/1.3.0/api/org/opentest4j/AssertionFailedError.html), which derives from Java's [`java.lng.AssertionError`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/AssertionError.html).

## How to use this?

The class `name.heavycarbon.checks.BasicChecks` exports a set of static methods that can be placed into code to perform runtime checks of the presumed program state. Some of these take messages with placeholders and the corresponding arguments as a vararg array. The placeholders in the messages can be [printf style](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html) or [SLF4J style](http://slf4j.org/faq.html#logging_performance) (i.e. the placeholder is indicated by '{}').

`name.heavycarbon.checks.BasicChecks` can be included statically:

~~~
import static name.heavycarbon.checks.BasicChecks.*
~~~
 
Then call the static methods like this:

~~~
Long x = callStuff();
checkNotNull(x):
~~~
 
Some methods return the object that was checked, so you may write:

~~~
Long x = checkNotNull(callStuff()):
~~~

## Exceptions thrown

All of the methods throw `CheckFailedException` derived from [`RuntimeException`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/RuntimeException.html), instead of the following:

* [`IllegalArgumentException`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html), which seems appropriate for argument checks only ;
* [`IllegalStateException`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/IllegalStateException.html), for which it is difficult to say when it is appropriate ;
* [`NullPointerException`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html), for which it is difficult to say when it is appropriate and IMHO indicates a bare programming error ;
* [`Error`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Error.html), which should terminate the thread and possibly the JVM, (in particular, [`AssertionError`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/AssertionError.html) falls into this category)
 
Thus:

* You don't need to declare a "throws" clause on the methods all along the call stack ; 
* You can catch and handle the exception if you need to and you are in a place where handling it makes sense ;
* It is clear that it comes from a "Check" method ; 
* It is not considered as unresolvable as an `Error`.

## Example

Code written if you are feeling lazy and don't care that `assert` should not be used to check parameters. `assert` will throw a a nasty `Error` instead of a `RuntimeException` if one of the checks fail, and may well be switched off at runtime:

~~~
public Map<SamId,SamAddressData> build(List<SamAddress> sal, AdminStructure ads, Integer idx) {
     assert sal!=null && !sal.isEmpty() : "SamAddress list is null or empty";
     assert ads!=null : "AdminStructure is null";
     assert idx!=null && idx > 0 : "Integer index is " + idx;
     assert ads.knowsAbout(idx) : "AdminStructure does not know about index " + idx;
     ...
~~~
    
Code written using `Check` methods. You will get catchable `CheckFailedException` and the checks will always be performed:

~~~
public Map<SamId,SamAddressData> build(List<SamAddress> sal, AdminStructure ads, Integer idx) {
     checkNotNullAndNotEmpty(sal,"SamAddress list");
     checkNotNull(ads,"AdminStructure");
     checkNotNullAndLargerThanZero(idx,"Integer index");
     checkTrue(ads.knowsAbout(idx),"AdminStructure does not know about index {}", idx);
     ....
~~~

Another example:

~~~
static InputStream getStreamFromFile(File fileName) {
     checkNotNull(fileName, "file name")
     checkTrue(fileName.exists(), "The file '{}' does not exist", fileName)
     checkTrue(fileName.isFile(), "The file '{}' is not a 'normal' file", fileName)
     checkTrue(fileName.canRead(), "The file '{}' is not readable", fileName)
     return new FileInputStream(fileName)
}
~~~

## Building bytecode and source jars

Use the [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) tool for this. See the `pom.xml` project declaration for details.

## Ideas for Improvements

* Use [paranamer](https://github.com/paul-hammant/paranamer) to determine parameter names at runtime.
